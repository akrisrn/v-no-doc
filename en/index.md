::: .readonly.danger.bold English is not my native language, please excuse my wrong sentences in this documentation. To be honest, writing English is really difficult for me. <br>I would be grateful if someone could correct my mistakes, feel free to create pull request!

This site is powered by [v-no](https://github.com/akrisrn/v-no) itself, and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/akrisrn/v-no-doc).

- You can go to [](/en/README.md "#") if you don't know what is v-no (Spoiler: It is yet another static site generator).
- All pages are listed in [](/en/archives.md "#") and [](/en/categories.md "#").
- There is a [](/en/search.md "#") page where you can query something.
- And the backlinks at the page bottom will take you to roam around there also.

Enjoy it.

::: This site won't update immediately after editing source file because of CDN cache. <br>If you don't need CDN, you can disable it.
Execute it in browser console to disable CDN:

```js
vno.path.disableCDN();
```

Maybe you will enable it again:

```js
vno.path.enableCDN();
```

If there's no way to open console, you can click this two buttons to perform the same thing:

<button class="btn danger" onclick="vno.path.disableCDN();">disableCDN</button> <button class="btn success" onclick="vno.path.enableCDN();">enableCDN</button>
